**R** is a series consisting of five canvases, each painted over in stages. So whether this means five paintings in 20 states or 100 different paintings is a question.

These paintings were not meant to be seen, except in reproduction.

I thought of these paintings as drawings.

All no longer exist, as the canvases were destroyed once the series was complete.
