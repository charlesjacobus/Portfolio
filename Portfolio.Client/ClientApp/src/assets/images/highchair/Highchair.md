**Highchair for Triplets** is a piece of furniture. I designed and constructed it of maple, green felt (the fat fruit), and plastic yellow rhinestones. Not a single nail or screw holds it together; as shown in the drawings, the components of the chair interlocked with dovetail, lap, and dowel joints.  

The felt and rhinestones are an ornamental detail not especially evident in the drawings or photographs, being mounted under each of the three seats, including the one closest to the ground. The rhinestones were arranged as constellations.  

Consisting of three sections, which when assembled stood 6 feet tall (72" x 15" x 12"), the chair never stood as a single piece again once these photographs were taken shortly after its construction.  

The conception of the chair coincided with my introduction to Erik Satie. In retrospect, the chair is an homage, being equal parts mystical and mischievous.
