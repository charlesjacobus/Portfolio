Along with several haibun, these haiga accompany the New York Haiku, which is a collection of poems about New York City.  

This work conveys the seasonal (_kigo_) characteristics of traditional haiku, as a seasonal period in one’s life. For the New York Haiku, that period was the six years I lived in New York City.  

The following is a selection of the poems from the New York Haiku.  
  
...  
  
said the skyscraper,  
“I spy for dead empires”  
to the cloud, passing  

painting a closet  
full of Bob and Charlotte’s clothes  
Appalachian Spring    

King Kong, you’ve spoken  
about empires, beauties  
and ziggurat form  

planted, in boxers  
merely, before a dead king  
who will outlive me  

walking west on Wall  
into the light of morning  
the street said DIG JOB  

beautiful people  
fully appreciating  
Mayakovsky’s scowl  

written in Hebrew  
the book-length poem wrote itself  
a Möbius strip  

when Derrida spoke  
people shuffled in their seats  
and thought about love  

cold, naked branches  
revealing nests abandoned,  
wind-whipped plastic bags  

midnight now, so smoke  
so to kiss the day goodnight  
behind irons gate  

...
