The Watershed Project immediately followed the Handrail Project, continuing my use of an architectural model for exploring aesthetic ideas.  

Where the Handrail Project provided a broad theoretical framework for considering both the relationship between the senses of sight and touch and the influence of the sense of touch on the arts throughout history, the Watershed Project explored a few particular aspects of the tactile aesthetic: shallow space, serial form, subtle variation, and the irrational.  

The Watershed Project was realized only with drawings like those included here. (I made no paintings at the time.) And it may have culminated with &mdash; at least in my mind &mdash; a separate project, the Relief House. Many years later, I came to realize that the Relief House was an attempt to burn the Watershed down.  

The Relief House now is a never-ending prose; it will never be complete just as the fire can never be extinguished. This is how it begins.  

...  

The Relief House is a firehouse with no engine; the Relief House is a counterpoint to a watershed.  

The Relief House burned, and no amount of water could extinguish the flame. When all the wells ran dry, the townspeople voted unanimously to stop the fire fighting effort and to let the fire exhaust itself naturally. After the first rains and snows failed to extinguish the fire, the magnitude of the problem became more apparent.  

Artists and poets seized upon the house for the subject of their pictures and poems. Some set up easels and others tripods. Others stood still before the house and composed poetry automatically. Careless videos proliferated and were watched by millions, aimlessly. Critics argued over the aesthetic merits of the house and the meaning of its significant form. Many imposed on its rage and in its dance references to the so-called ancients and primitives, theories invoking integrity and passions and truths that they were happy to share. One particularly sensitive poet reflected on the magical contrasts between the cool fall temperatures and the warmth of the flame and its embers, relating it to the brilliant blood red of a solitary Japanese maple in the crisp night air.  

The Relief House quickly became the cynosure of the town in which it raged. What was once an insignificant and nameless place emerged as a location of significance - a place that people from all over the world had heard of and came to visit.  

The Relief House burned in America.  

The Relief House brought agency to the watershed, by expressing the house as it was perceived. This is the difference between planning and doing.  

The Relief House caught fire - some say spontaneously - and the fire never stopped, no matter the method nor the magnitude of the effort to extinguish it.  

The house had been unoccupied for years. Many of the neighboring residents initially and privately considered the fire a blessing.  

People came forward with money-making schemes to harness the fire. They included using it as a garbage incinerator and building an elaborate network of vents to heat the homes in the area. One particularly pious group, believing that the fire was a holy spirit or simultaneously a foretelling of a holy spirit, sold candles lit by the house flame. Their venture proved unsuccessful, however, because the candles burned out quickly, as if lit by an ordinary match.  

The Relief House caught fire on a cold November night. People bundled up and came out to watch. They talked as the firemen worked and the house burned. Because of the odd material construction of the house, the fire burned unevenly. Much of the house smoldered, and in the dark of the night some of the stone walls appeared to glow. Since the house hadn't been occupied in many years, the effort to control the flame was concentrated on the exterior. There was talk of arson, but the question on everyone's mind was motive.  

Philosophers were called, when fire crews failed to put out the fire. After much concentrated deliberation, they posited that the only thing capable of extinguishing the fire was the suffocating weight of the past.  

The Relief House had been burning for as long as anyone could remember. Children asked their parents and them their own about the cause of the fire, but no one could remember. Or, they remembered differently. Even the oldest residents were ignorant of its origin, but still closely identified with it. The fire figured prominently in local lore, and stories of the house were passed down among generations as a kind of local folk wisdom.  

Clearly the Relief House had been built, for there it stood.  

Smoke from the fire steadily billowed up and over the town in accord with the wind. Hot, dry summer days were bad, but rainy days were worse since the rain caused the fire to smolder and fume an ashen brown. Many residents of the area, especially the children, suffered from a debilitating asthma.  

Over the years, the fire transformed the Relief House in people's imaginations from a cultural or spiritual phenomenon to a natural one. Just as mountains and seas have no discernable beginning or end and no apparent purpose, the Relief House too transcended time and meaning in the minds of those who considered it. The fire had ceased to be an event and had become a fact.  

Word of the Relief House spread quickly, first among the neighboring towns and then throughout the state, the country, and eventually the world. Not knowing how to explain the fire, people attributed it to an act of God. They found what they believed were references to the house in the Bible, the Koran, and other sacred texts. The townspeople suddenly found themselves playing host to a steady stream of religious pilgrims and tourists. The local economy even flourished for a time, due to an aggressive and gaudy capitalization of the phenomenon.  

Owing to its unique architecture, the house appeared from some perspectives to be in a bas-relief. Approached from certain directions, its projection was so shallow and distorted as to make it practically invisible. Unfortunately, first responders arrived from the east side of town, which presented them with barely a surface to begin their work, causing confusion and frustrating the process of extinguishing the flames before they consumed the entire structure.  

The flames leapt from each of the windows in a discordant visual harmony, both regular and irregular. It was beautiful.  

The Relief House was forgotten, and yet it continued to burn. It seared in the collective memory, so the collective amnesia amounted to madness. If it had engulfed the whole world, there would be no difference. In fact it had, in the minds of mankind. It still burned. To those who could recall, the memories were seldom shared. And to those who could not, the very obvious fact of the house made little difference in their denial. They believed their denial an act of self-preservation, when it was in fact their undoing.  

The Relief House sparked a great intellectual debate about whether the house was burnt or unburnt. The rationale being clear: while the house continued to burn, yet it stood.  

Given its architectural characteristics, with the fire and smoke now considered by historians to be a permanent fixture of the facade, the Relief House existed in the fourth dimension. Never before had the interplay between time and space been used to such effect in architectural design. The closest comparison was to light and shadow, in the way it established a temporal variance in the form and definition on three dimensional space and two dimensional surface. But in the final analysis, light and shadow remain a product of the environment in which a structure exists as distinct from being elementally inherent in the construction, however that came about.  

Material composition of the Relief House consisted primarily of stone and wood, in a unique interwoven fabrication that had no known historical precedent. Throughout the structure, wood and stone interlaced in a veining construction to produce both beautiful ornamental detail and uncompromising support. Video sampling of the interior of the structure showed no signs of material compromise, aside from some relatively minor charring and glow. So a key question was whether this unique construction created an equilibrium supporting an inexhaustible fire or one that was just very slow to burn.  

Periodically over the intervening years, various people confessed to the arson, all with accounts inconsistent with actual events. For some would-be arsonists, their own births unwittingly succeeded the fire's origin. Understandably, each eager to find significance in their own lives through association with the timelessness of the Relief House.  

In conditions of storm and high wind, the fire would occasionally jump across the firebreak that had been established by the park service onto other surfaces, sparking new fires. Although these were quickly extinguished.  

People recall the Relief House. But their recollections are delusions or dreams or retellings, for they have never seen it.  

The fire both gave breath and it breathed, as a spirit.  

The heat from the Relief House fire was intense. And so naturally, people stood some distance from it. But even then, the intensity of the specter radiated through the clothes and into the flesh of those who stayed too long. And that heat remained with them, in their eyes and on their flesh and deeper still, for a long while after their departure. Many described this warmth as being interior, although physically felt on the surface. And that it would ebb and return, as memories drift.  

From the sides by which it could be seen, art critics reflected on the house with their pages of prose that bore little resemblance to the event that it was and more to the needs of the persons that they were. From this occupation, the cleverest among them made a decent living.  

The Relief House could be disorienting because the fire burned unevenly, producing great flames and smoke plumes and emberred glows variously and over time. Being a focal point of attention, this wreaked havoc on the stability of the cardinal points, in the approximation of many. The earth moved. Such disorientation caused agitation and anxiety when self-reflected. So this was discouraged by the park service, by developing processes designed to comfort people and systems to direct them to the correct parking lot.  

Difficult to talk over, the fire roared and swooshed in accord with the intensity of the flame. The speaking of tongues was figurative, but it spoke over those who listened. During periods in which the fire principally smoldered, it listened.  

Some people claimed to have discovered a calendrical system in the character of the house, as it responded to changes in the environment over weeks and years. The house, as they saw it, established a grammar that brought order to the natural world. Using this system, they could sometimes predict changes in the intensity of the flame for example, or the direction in which the smoke billowed. But as these phenomenon were  predictable by the environmental factors that preceded them, this system was considered self-referential and so not taken seriously. The model predicted the subject and vice versa. Others saw in the house the order of the natural world, which could not always be put into words but which innately made sense, being one's self a part of the world.  

The smarter students, by using certain fallacies methodically, were able to approach the Relief House tangentially. (Compare this to a hall of mirrors.) Through this method of obscure description, they thought they were able to glean insights into the meaning of the Relief House, as one sometimes first catches glimpses peripherally. But this only worked when the structure of their approach was symbiotic with the house structure itself. In later communicating these insights, they sounded like nonsense.  

For instance, it was noted how interesting it is that a place can be so different over time. This observation felt substantial, but besides further contemplation there was little more to be done with it.  

When considered as a model, those witnessing the Relief House recognized themselves uncomfortably as mere facts, or simple elements of that model. Their discomfort stemmed only in part that they were simultaneously the modelers and the ones being modeled. And of course in part that they were reduced to mere facts.  

Imagine the two of us standing and talking together while we watch the Relief House burn.  

The Relief House is a prose that reflects the house, which is the watershed. The reflection is a representation.  

A theory: the Relief House was extraterrestrial.  

Because no one living had ever been inside the Relief House, it could not be confirmed whether the house existed in the second or third dimension. (That it existed in the fourth dimension has already been established.) Surveyors and engineers ran calculations from the sides available to them, trying to arrive at a stable measurement of plan and volume. But for the spacetime discontinuities resulting from each of their data over the hours and days and weeks it took to produce and for the difficulties resulting from the practical matter of the fire, their attempts failed to establish anything definitive.    

The Relief House had no back side, as in "the backyard" or "the back of the house" or "out back".  

Being enigmatic, the Relief House presented windows on only one side and doors on two. (Although one of those two sides was difficult to approach.) The subtle variation in the spacing of the windows suggested a clue. This variation was so subtle that it could not be trusted by sight alone; it required the hands and body haptically, which was of course now impossible. In this respect, the fire brought the Relief House into a more classical Western perspective, favoring visual depth. This was in antithesis of the extreme shallow planing and ornamentation of some early Medieval Italian church facades, for example, and in correspondence of that elaboration in the High Renaissance period.  

The Relief House consists of eight or nine rooms, each in plan exactly the same but still serving different functions according to need. In volume, two of the rooms are barely perceptibly larger. This variance is a purely aesthetic detail.  

The Relief House was the product of the people who witnessed it. From them, through their own interior lives, the house was manifest. That is why it was certified a cultural landmark &mdash; because it reflected the motivations and acts of mankind through the ages. As such, the house was collectively recognized as being a terrible tragedy, by the impossibility of reconciling the tension between the physical immediacy of the structure and the boundless temporality inherent in the event.  

That the Relief House fire could never be extinguished but is spoken of in the past imperfect tense was not an irony; it was essential to the nature of the form.  

Probability theorists reasoned both that the fire would soon exhaust itself and that it would rage forever. They pointed out that the raw material of a house does not provide enough fuel to allow the structure to burn indefinitely and that there is no known historical record of such incidents. And of course there are natural physical laws, etc. So by entailment applied through probabilistic reasoning they maintained that the fire should soon wane. Some held this position over many years. Others concluded that since the fire had been burning for a very long time and showed no signs of change, despite historical precedent and every effort to extinguish it, that it would burn forever - or at least as long as forever held any meaning for mankind. Their models used expressions showing mathematically that the longer the Relief House burned, the greater the probability it would not cease to burn. Both positions implied, incorrectly and oppositionally, a causal nexus.  

The Relief House has two parallel hallways, only one of which could be physically traversed. (The other hallway was for the eyes only, in passing.) At the end of the main hallway was a great library, with few books.  

The interior of the Relief House impressed upon the exterior, creating the fire. The fire was not born of combustion but of compression.  

The Relief House could no longer be touched.  

It was suggested that the fire could not be extinguished because the Relief House structure existed at a symbolic level without sufficient congruence to essential key structures of the physical, natural world. This also helped explain its physical anomalies, as previously mentioned. But this was not the case; it was in fact that the watershed, not the Relief House, would be extinguished.  

The Relief House cast shadows, as an extension of its structure. Depending on the time of day and in relation to where you stood, the shadows reflected the structure itself or the immediate surroundings, which is analogous to dichotomies like exterior/interior or cool/warm.  

In the minds of those who directly experienced the Relief House and those who only learned of it through pictures and words, the Relief House is now the same.  

We believe that the Relief House cannot burn forever, even though it will burn longer than our ability to witness. Unlike the Sun, of which scientists have some reasonable astronomical and chemical understanding and so can predict its eventual end, the Relief House is so far beyond understanding. Consequently, this conviction that it cannot burn forever is an act of faith rather than fact. Although that faith is in broader natural laws, not mythologies.  

While standing before the Relief House, most people believe that it exists. Others, having only experienced the Relief House through media or having only heard of it, may also believe that it exists. For each, the fact of its existence is equivalent, to the extent that they believe it.  

What history could be made of the Relief House should it be spoken of or put in a book? The fire raged, and in time this had a bearing on history. It affected people, who witnessed it and who considered its significance and who related it to others. But the Relief House itself was by its very existence and significance unchanged. So there was no history in the house per se.
