**&mdash;all earth, water, and sky** began as a part the series **A Death in the Family**, but over the years of its making (2020 - 2023) the subject changed several times and the painting reworked, finally evolving it out of the "Death" series conceptually.  

As with the paintings in that series, this one is composed over chromatic blocks and sequences and uses traditional painting technique to explore subtle shifts in surface and color handling (generally, tone).  

This one feels to me more like a portrait than a landscape.   

The title is enigmatic but apt, and so it remains. It was sourced from a book I read at some point during the making of the painting.
