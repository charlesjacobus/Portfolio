sipping sweet Coney Island  
fog through my white teeth  
and Sprite to calm my stomach
   
we watched the action  
at a distance like science

projects horizon  
drab terracotta, not gold  
housed a million souls  
with views of the Atlantic

past a carnival  
wreckage where fire once burned  
in early modern  
twilight possibilities

African fierceness  
elephants smoked cigarettes  
cancer killing some  
electricity the rest

closeted freak shows  
American cinema  
illuminating  
our potential for violence

out there, by the surf  
shrouded in uncertainty

Weegee shot us too  
in the back, black and white, crooks  
bathers and mad crowds  
sulking, drunken bartenders

served flights of whiskey  
clouding our ability  
to recall, without  
rank, filter, or empathy  

of which, we felt none  
for youth budding, not yet spent

where Adam and Eve  
disrobed and swam with sea lice  
causing a furor  
among homosexuals

and red raconteurs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Dmitri Shostakovich*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*constructed a house*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*over the quicksand of time*

told sad stories of  
segregated swimming pools  
empty, with lifeguards  
bored, asleep on a high perch

above their daughters  
who escaped menâ€™s wicked dreams  
in dark theatres  
projecting life somewhere else

between our bodies  
acres of sand and gull sounds

until you returned  
to tell tales of our future  
forever crossing  
the Verrazano-Narrows
