**Leet** is a lifetime series and now a game.  

The series consists of three compositions (G, M and F). For purposes of this game, the composition is randomly chosen with colors that are randomly generated.  

Each leet is described by a code. The code produces a cartoon, which is a plan. I use the plan to produce the leet, which is a 42 x 30 inch oil painting on stretched cotton duck canvas.  

The game involves a commission, in the form of a commercial transaction - an oil painting for money. The amount of money is up to you, but it must include materials ($50), packing ($20), and shipping costs (TBD). Shipping costs are provided once I have a delivery address. Should you take receipt of the painting in person, the packing and shipping costs are of course waived.  

Once I begin a leet, I will complete it. But multiple commission requests are priority queued, by price paid over materials, packing, and shipping costs. This means the lower your price point, the longer you may have to wait. Of course, it also means that if your price point is low and you don't wait long, then I'm likely pwned.  

To participate: Under **Game**, click **Create Cartoon** until you find a leet you like. Then click **Order Leet**. If that doesn't work, click **Capture Code** to put the leet code on your clipboard, which you can email me.  

We'll discuss payment terms once you place your order.  

I have the right to refuse this game prior to accepting a commission, and I may end it at any time.
