While not a writer, I write.  

From the start, my sketchbooks have been filled with notes and ideas and lists. In fact my very earliest sketchbooks and notebooks consisted almost entirely of the written word, with little other drawing.  

While that is no longer true, I continue to feel that writing is an essential part of my practice. Or, I feel little need to distinguish between the visual and written work.
