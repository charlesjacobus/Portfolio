While not a writer, I write.  

From the start, my sketchbooks have been filled with notes and ideas and lists. In fact the very earliest sketchbooks or notebooks consisted almost entirely of the written word, with very little other drawing.  

Consequently, I feel these writings are an essential part of my practice. Or, I see little need to distinguish between the visual and written work.
