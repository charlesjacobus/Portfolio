    <div class="title">The Dogs in My Life</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Periodically, I've found a subject in the dogs in my life. These drawings represent just a few of the many times I've faced the question of what to draw, being answered by an unsuspecting canine companion.</div>
    <img class="imageHorizontalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.1.jpg" title="Samantha" />
    <div class="label">Samantha : 1998 : pencil on paper : 6 x 8 inches</div>
    <img class="imageVerticalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.9.jpg" title="Samantha" />
    <div class="label">Samantha : 1998 : pencil on paper : 10 x 8 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Samantha was a sweet, if high strung, golden labrador. She was adopted, like the others, and lived out the rest of her long life in quiet domesticity.</div>

    <div class="label">Samantha : 1998 : pencil on paper : 8 x 10 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The drawings are concentrations on (studies of) the figure, which of course has a very long tradition going back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_art" target="_blank">the earliest drawings</a>, many also of the animals in the lives of those who made them. In these drawings, there is no personal or bold expression, except as depiction of form. Capturing the essence and character of each is all I'm after.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The drawings often come quickly &mdash; for practical reasons after all &mdash; taking mere minutes, with the line laid down rapidly and in most examples with little erasure or rework. Although discovery is a significant part of even this drawing process. Some lines or marks may come later, or be emphasized or diminished, upon a second or third look.</div>
    <img class="imageVerticalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.13.jpg" title="Missi" />
    <div class="label">Missi : 2006 : pencil on paper : 24 x 18 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Missi was another rescue. We watched her spend her first year in the neighbor's backyard mostly alone, outside our kitchen window.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">My choice of materials is typically graphite pencil and stick but includes other conventional media, like charcoal, chalk, and ink.</div>
    <img class="imageVerticalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.8.jpg" title="Missi" />
    <div class="label">Missi : 2005 : charcoal on paper : 17 x 13 inches</div>
    <img class="imageHorizontalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.3.jpg" title="Missi" />
    <div class="label">Missi : 2003 : chalk on paper : 8 x 10 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">These are a few recent drawings of Winston, our wily bluetick beagle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As with the drawings I made 25 years ago, we see him sleeping and eating and scratching and doing other dog things.</div>
    <img class="imageHorizontalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.41.jpg" title="Winston" />
    <div class="label">Winston : 2023 : pencil on paper : 12 x 9 inches (each page)</div>
    <img class="imageHorizontalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.27.jpg" title="Winston" />
    <div class="label">Winston : 2023 : pencil on paper : 9 x 12 inches</div>
    <img class="imageVerticalWidth" src="/assets/images/dogs/Figures.L.26.jpg" title="Winston" />
    <div class="label">Winston : 2023 : pencil on paper : 12 x 8 inches</div>
