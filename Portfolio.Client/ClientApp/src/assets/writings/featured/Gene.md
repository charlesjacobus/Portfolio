    <div class="title">Five for Gene</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In memoriam: My dear old friend, with whom I lost touch years ago, died recently.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This is not entirely true; in fact he died several years ago, but I learned of his death only recently. That distinction, philosophical and subtle as it is, might have been the topic of one our many abstract conversations, sitting together at the tall table in the studio or on the couch during one of my visits to his home, discussing painting mostly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I last saw Gene at my wedding. And as life got more complicated while starting out married life in a faraway city and later raising a child, we never spoke again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Again, not entirely true. I called him in 2001 shortly after September 11th, which occurred shortly after our move back to Texas. The dispondancy in his voice was I believe not entirely related to that dark day, but it felt at the time like the end of something. And so I never called again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I made these small paintings a few years later &mdash; an homage to Gene, but more specifically to an aesthetic we shared and that continues to be singularly significant to my work and way of thinking.</div>

    <div class="paragraph">Each of these five paintings was done in oil on oak panel. In some, you can see the wood grain through the thinner paint application, which added I believe to their object quality. Five panels each subdivided into five panels, invoking longstanding numerological and musical interests.</div>

    <div class="paragraph">Arriving at exactly the right time in my life while attending graduate school, what still strikes me about the suggestion on the back of his now-yellowing postcard is that tactility in the visual arts is primarily a visual concern. The flowers sit tightly in the vase, field and ground a nearly monochrome ochre yellow that stirs the hand like a shallow relief. Compositional tension built from interstitial forces, even though this one depicts no other tabletop objects.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Like my friend, these paintings are now gone. But in their time, what they meant to me &mdash; their content, as it were &mdash; was the idea of tactility as an aesthetic criteria for painting, in a pedagogical sense. And for this guidance and his spirit as a teacher, I am forever grateful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Rest in peace, my friend.</div>
