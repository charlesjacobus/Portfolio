    <div class="title">Drawing</div>
    <div class="paragraph">After inquiring with someone at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Academy_of_Cincinnati" target="_blank">Art Academy of Cincinnati</a> and finally receiving a number, my 30-year old self decided to give Ruth a call. I didn't know Ruth, and I had never spoken with her. I learned of her through an inscription on the back of this photograph, taken at the Academy where she and my grandfather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Staples_Dodge" target="_blank">Richard Staples Dodge</a>, studied in the late 1930s. (Their classmates included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginnie_Hofmann" target="_blank">Ginnie Hofmann</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Flora" target="_blank">James Flora</a>, and Sidney Koblenz.) Here is Ruth painting my grandfather's portrait.</div>

    <div class="paragraph">As I prepared to call, I didn't know what to expect. Most likely, no answer. Or perhaps confusion, or embarrassment or reluctance to speak. The phone rang, and Ruth answered. After some awkward pleasantries, I introduced myself: "I'm Richard Dodge's grandson". Silence. And then a pouring forth of excited story telling and what sounded like years of bottled memories. I spoke of his life, and she spoke of hers. She spoke endearingly of "Dick". Your grandfather drew very easily, she said.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This is true. For my grandfather, drawing seemed to come naturally. From his earliest student drawings in 1930s California, his technique and approach to drawing was as fine as any I've seen from the period. He laid his lines down confidently, if searchingly, and his sense of form and proportion was superb. His methods for defining tone were many and clearly well practiced. In the 1930s, there was still something of the academy even in an average high school art class in Sacramento apparently, and with Richard Dodge there was ample talent besides.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His sketchbooks at the time favored his surroundings, which naturally tended to <a href="https://tfaoi.org/aa/3aa/3aa23.htm" target="_blank">a kind of Regionalism</a>. Celebration of the American scene was the zeitgeist, with big themes ever-present: California's golden and still undeveloped hills; urban construction, like the newly completed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge" target="_blank">Tower Bridge</a>; small farms and shanties; workers working. All big subjects fit for an art meant to contribute to the New Deal and meet the average American where they were at.</div>

    <div class="paragraph">But something as simple as two tangerines is also worthy as a subject surely, if a red wheelbarrow is subject enough for a poem.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Let's not confuse subject with content though, because the real interest in this drawing is light and volume. The hatching and erasure make indelible the particulars of the fleshy, soft fitting fruit and their shadows. As well as the interstitial, as they once sat motionless for a time together &mdash; both the space between them and the space between them and me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This implies both spatial and temporal dimensions. Good drawings encapsulate time. These tangerines are every tangerine (or their prototypical potential), such as those you'll pass in cardboard boxes wrapped in green netting in the supermarket or those you've packed for lunch. These particular tangerines are now lost forever, save for what remains in this record, which makes the facts of their existence evident a while longer.</div>

    <div class="label">2016 : pencil on paper : 7 x 9 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A question to pose here is record as process or fact. Again, content versus subject.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the process is the act of seeing and the struggle (usually) to get down on the page some tactile and visceral spirit of the thing seen. Drawings in this sense are "technical", stemming from the same origin as "technique", but not in any sense that one could meaningfully describe except superficially. Nothing prescriptive; all art is artifice, but artifice without art is just artifice. The struggle is not with materials but with a realization one accepts as complete, because it captures something essential of the subject. "It works" would be perhaps the highest compliment.</div>

    <div class="paragraph"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Morandi" target="_blank">Giorgio Morandi</a> made this drawing in 1960. He would have been 70 years old, with only four years left to live. What we see here is evidence of someone who, having spent most of his life lived through two World Wars and persistent national political turmoil, decides once again to place a pitcher and some vases in close arrangement, to study them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In these vessels there are endless variations of intersection and eclipse and spatial relation. That would seem to state the obvious, unless one were to see in these gently crooked lines an aesthetic grounded in a strain of Italian art (Giotto, Fra Angelico, Pierro della Francesca) for which the metaphysical is born out of mass and weight and frontality.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Part of the genius of Morandi's work is in fact born out of the tension between that which is grounded and solid and centered and the realization of the ephemeral.</div>

    <div class="label">1960 : Still Life : 5 x 6.5 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Morandi finds in these vessels their essence not through rendering but in a touch corresponding to their arrangement. It is inherently abstract. Draftsmanship might not typically be a term used to describe this drawing, and yet it meets every qualification of the definition, if one accepts Morandi's intent on its merits.</div>

    <div class="paragraph">Earlier I distinguished process and fact, and I would add to that a discipline of practice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I've been making drawings regularly since childhood. The act of drawing for me is a practice that measures time, by producing product that captures in some way the periods of my life. In my drawings I sometimes feel in some sense what I felt in the moment of making or in those years in which I made them. And I'm reminded when I look at others that I could never make the same or similar drawing again, because that time has passed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I made this drawing in Brooklyn, in our apartment on Sterling Place. Angela would occasionally sit for me, and often the pose would settle into sleep. So here she is, laying on our futon sofa in her nightgown. There's a suggestion by erasure of her right arm having been lifted to raise her head. But it has since settled such that her hands are now restfully crossed. Her arm is slender and beautiful and still the same. There she is, as she once was. Her hair was longer then, tucked behind her ear, because she wanted it long for our wedding, which was still months away.</div>

    <div class="label">2000 : pencil on paper : 11 x 13.5 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As with all art forms, drawing has the capacity to operate as a counterenvironment &mdash; McLuhan's word, not mine. The act of seeing and the practice of doing are inherently political, as they push against the grain of acceptance of the everyday. (Less subtly, they can act in direct opposition to political and cultural forces. But that usually comes in the form of commentary or propaganda.) Style doesn't matter, but quality does. And what matters most is in the making.</div>
