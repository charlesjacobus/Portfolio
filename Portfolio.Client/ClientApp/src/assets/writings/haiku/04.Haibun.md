For several years while attending school, he and his brother lived together in a studio apartment in the East Village.  

Being naturally poor at that stage of life, they took work where they could find it. And one occasional source of income was odd jobs for family friends.  

Blanche’s friends, Bob and Charlotte, whom she had met years ago as neighbors on Wykeham Road in Washington, Connecticut, also had an apartment in the city, on Park Avenue. Always thrifty, Bob hired them to paint it – “paintning”, he would joke, to distinguish it from painting as art.  

Employed in this task, they asked Charlotte where to put the clothes that hung in the closet they were preparing to paint. She said simply, “to one side”.
