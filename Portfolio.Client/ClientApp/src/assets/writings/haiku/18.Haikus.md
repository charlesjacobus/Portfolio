coffee light not sweet  
disposable amphora  
warming hand and heart  

---

tunnel dynamics  
of tortoise and hare (redbird)  
races never won  

---

tea time at the Frick  
with a minister on skates  
fa la la la la  

---

from West 21st  
a sliver of New Jersey  
and America  

---

in the studio  
alone, with David Garland  
and one idea  

---

beautiful people  
fully appreciating  
Mayakovskyâ€™s scowl  

---

those three nights you worked  
Hejduk slept in ink-lined Bronx  
while I slept downtown  

---

Pharoah at the Knit  
draped in white and gold like God  
whose voice is a horn  

---

when Derrida spoke  
people shuffled in their seats  
and thought about love  

---

sidewalk stargazing  
train to stoop, woolgathering  
crystallization
