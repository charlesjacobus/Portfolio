**New York Haiku** is a more than 10 year on-again, off-again work, completed in 2020. Although the first haiku occurred to me while walking west on Wall Street one morning on the way to work, probably in 2000, I didn’t begin to concentrate on the project until 2009.  

I don’t know why haiku. While familiar with the form, as most people are, I’m certainly no expert. But as I considered the idea of capturing a transformative chapter of my life spent in New York City, the economy and spirit of haiku seemed particularly well-suited.  

New York City is enormous – a whole world really – and that enormity has filled my imagination and sense of self for as long as I can remember. We know from historical records that the Jacobus family has resided in and around New York City since the earliest Dutch settlers discovered its native shores. And every generation since has lived for at least some time in the city or its vicinity. So I feel that my love for the city must have some familial component, because even our first forays into it when I was a child left me with feelings of wonder and identity and place – somehow already strangely familiar.  

But what does one say about New York City, a place for which so much has already been said? The answer is simple: write what you know. So it turns out that these poems are not so much about New York City as about memories of time spent there.  

Memories are something I think a lot about, both specific memories and the idea of memory. Each a mental flash of personal recollection, taken together they constitute an entirety. Reading the haiku rekindles a younger self.  

For this project to have even a chance of being successful, I felt that its form must remain rigorously economical. The economy of the haiku requires a kind of condensed and considered concentration of thought, as a literary antidote to sentimentality and embellishment. Each poem is a kernel that encapsulates a perpetual trove of memories of a life lived. Most is left unsaid.  

Haikai is a poetic form rooted in Japanese tradition that includes haiku, senryū, haibun, and haiga. As applied in these pages, the poems are perhaps most appropriately described as haiku, adhering to a common adaptation of seventeen syllables in three lines of 5-7-5, respectively. From the outset, I believed it essential – contrary to common practice today – that this form remain fixed; there is no variation except in a few cases where punctuation involving new lines breaks the traditional structure.  

As a bookend, **Boardwalk Zoetrope** extends this further through a kind of linked verse (renku), while still adhering to the same formal principles. It uses an extended haiku form consisting of paired couplet and quatrain stanzas (4 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 2 4), with a conventional syllabic meter (5 7 5).  

Some of the haiku are accompanied by interludes of short prose in the spirit of haibun. And <a href="/exhibits/haiga">the drawings</a> are haiga, visual meditations on the same subject in a style loosely reflective of a Japanese aesthetic.  

Taken as a whole, this work conveys for me the seasonal (kigo) characteristics of traditional haiku, as a period in one’s life. For the New York Haiku, that means the six years (1994-1996, 1998-2001) that I lived in New York City. In essence, this represents a period or season of my life, much like a chapter from a great novel in which one is written in briefly as a protagonist.
