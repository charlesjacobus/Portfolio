Working for several years at 2 Rector Street and on lower Broadway, he spent time around Trinity Church and its welcoming Churchyard.  

On some summer mid-mornings, he observed preschool children crossing the iron footbridge over Trinity Place to the historic grounds and cemetery. From above the sidewalks, where so many business people trod in heavy shoes and tight collars, these children defied the staid and serious bustle with a naked glee as they ran through improvised sprinklers, dancing merrily on the ancient shale stones of the dead.

children like cherubs  
laughing and running among  
the Trinity stones
