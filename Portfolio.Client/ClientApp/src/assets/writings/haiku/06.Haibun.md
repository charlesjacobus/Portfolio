Walking east along 42nd Street early one morning to catch the Harlem line north to Brewster for a weekend in Connecticut, he was approached by a disheveled man compelled by something profound.  

The view of the Chrysler Building from along Bryant Park is magnificent, a majestic testament to forward progress. While being directed toward that view, the man declared that a great ape had once climbed “that building”.  

Politely, he corrected the man that it was in fact the Empire State Building, just several blocks south, not the Chrysler Building that the ape had once ascended.  

Satisfied, the stranger shuffled along.

King Kong, you’ve spoken  
about empires, beauties  
and ziggurat form
