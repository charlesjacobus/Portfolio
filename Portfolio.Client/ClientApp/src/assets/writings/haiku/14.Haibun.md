As a young couple, living in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn near Park Slope, they enjoyed evening walks along ginkgo leaved streets, lined with brownstones and federalist brick row houses and other Grand architectures. Heaving from the pressures of time, the bluestone sidewalks suggested a measured pace.  

On these walks they took pleasure in the company of one another: telling stories, making plans, and stealing glances at the lives of others, acted out silently but theatrically through warmly illuminated bay windows.
