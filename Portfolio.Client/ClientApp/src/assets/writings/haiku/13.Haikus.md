across Long Meadow  
bodies of every color  
points of a Seurat  

---

walking west on Wall  
into the light of morning  
the street said DIG JOB  

---

schooners, brigs, barks: crafts  
crisscrossing New-York harbor  
duck cloth billowing ghosts  

---

cold, naked branches  
revealing nests abandoned,  
wind-whipped plastic bags  

---

turnpike rendezvous  
without clothes, stripped bare, sculling  
breaking the Large Glass  

---

Balthus by the bell  
after Philadelphia  
violin lesson  

---

kamikaze kids  
on sleds, snow covered park slopes,  
scream down mud-worn tracks
