During the work week, his typical morning routine was to stop by a small standing-room only coffee shop in the shadow of the World Trade Center.  

While waiting for his usual, fried eggs on toasted roll – wrapped up in the back, thrown across the kitchen like a drive from Rivers to Dent in more turbulent times and golden days, before being stuffed into a paper sack – he enjoyed the congenial banter between the kitchen (in white) and the Wall Street patrons (in blue), literally worlds apart, bullshitting over a counter, always about sports.
