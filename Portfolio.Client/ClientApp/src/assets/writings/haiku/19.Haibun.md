For several years at precisely midnight, he walked home from his studio on West 21st Street, down Fifth Avenue, and across town on East 10th Street.  

On the block east of St. Markâ€™s Church in-the-Bowery at Second Avenue, the sidewalks narrowed, overflowing with trash in battered and overwhelmed cans on both sides of the sidewalk, endlessly spewing East Village detritus.  

He both cringed at and thrilled in, as one might watch a horror film, the tinny sounds and brown bodies scurrying back and forth under the lamplight glow, sometimes just inches away.

midnightly walks past  
Stuyvesant entombed and rats  
in cans, surviving
