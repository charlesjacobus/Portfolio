Walking downtown early one morning, he turned south onto Greene Street. With a patchwork of aged cobblestone and worn asphalt, fronted by ornate cast iron facades, and touched by a lifting fog, it was presently empty of the crowds who were sure to come or who had recently retired from revelry.  

Suddenly, a door burst open and a couple emerged that he recognized by their far away beauty sold through so many now-discarded periodicals and television shows. Holding hands, laughing, she stepped off the sidewalk and leapt gracefully over a potted puddle. In that moment, in the blink of an eye, they both vanished.
