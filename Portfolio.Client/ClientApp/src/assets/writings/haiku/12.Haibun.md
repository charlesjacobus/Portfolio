Negotiating his way through a labyrinth of tunnels, crowded and buzzing with energy and anticipation, the space opened dramatically as he entered Grand Centralâ€™s main concourse: confined space suddenly cavernous.  

The low din of 10,000 lives was accompanied by a small jazz ensemble celebrating the centennial of the New York City subway. He stopped to watch a projection of archival footage, undercranked and radiating warm sepia tones of New Yorkers now long gone navigating their vibrant city, going about their busy lives.  

Then the music stopped.  

But the film continued, without the animating qualities of a musical pulse. The people on the screen who had moments before been alight with purpose and life suddenly appeared as ghosts, shadows of those around him.
