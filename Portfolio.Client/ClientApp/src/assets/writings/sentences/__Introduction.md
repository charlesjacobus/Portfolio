The idea is the same as before - giving agency to the ordinary, because that's all we have.

It never occurred to me to write about things I don't know or haven't experienced.

Some time ago, I had the happy idea to record every memory, and these poems are part of that larger project.

Happy, precisely for its impossibility and promise of longevity - something to do.

The term "memory" is here defined broadly to include direct experience, recollection, and recognition, with all of course being entangled.

There is nothing confessional in these poems.

The memory representation is not embellished, but I'm under no illusion that the telling is exactly as occurred.

In fact, the retelling is intrinsic to the memory by providing definition.

Each poem is successful only to the extent that it resonates harmoniously with its subject.

A preponderance of the poems are about food, or centered around food, for reasons I don't know.

I'm not sure what the poems might communicate.

I find that many people do not know how to communicate well, and I wonder what that means about their lived experience.

In these sentences, the mental spark that gives each word meaning sometimes represents a significant amount of physical time and activity in my past.

I chose the sentence as a formal structure first for it's colloquialism; it's how we speak.

A sentence is perhaps the most economic linguistic unit capable of a complete complex expression.

Consequently, this verse explores encapsulation as a poetic technique.

If the sentences don't look or read like poems, that's the idea.

The poems should be read as sentences, naturally and with only punctuation-aided pauses, before being read visually (this more suggestion than instruction).

The sentences are presented using conventional phrasing technique, mostly through line breaks, to emphasize meter and to make possible other poetic devices like enjambment.

The sentences are punctuated correctly.

Every word is considered carefully, and the process of composition is almost always iterative.

Rhyme plays no role in word choice - in fact, I typically avoid it - but word choice is especially significant.

Naturally, as this is serious stuff and there are so few words.

Alliteration is sometimes used to stimulate the tactile sense but is not essential to the poem structure.

The alliterative phrases create their own meter, which acts as a counterpoint to the meter of the line.

Often, the poems appear only after I begin writing them.

While completing any one of the poems, I invariably feel it will be the last.

I don't object to the idea that any old sentence could be a poem, although I do believe that context and framing in art is essential.

There's no significance to the number of lines in each poem, but I am aware while writing whether they end on an even or odd numbered line.

I don't know if any of this work would be considered art, and at this point I really don't care.

The poems are untitled.

I have wondered if anyone else has written one-sentence poems (inevitably), but I haven't checked.

I don't know much about poetry, but the idea of a poetic form that captures something distinctly American has long interested me.

What that means exactly is hard to say, but you likely know what I mean.

I am not a writer, but I admit to feeling confident in having some sensibility and an understanding of the craft of writing.

I certainly enjoyed writing each of these sentences.
