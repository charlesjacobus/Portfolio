Perched precariously  
thirteen floors  
over West 21st Street  
on the sill  
of an open window  
enjoying the breezy  
cacophony of the urban   
canyon, I contemplated  
the real possibility  
of suicide and  
the impossible distance  
of the models at work  
in the loft  
across the street  
and of America  
beyond the Hudson.
