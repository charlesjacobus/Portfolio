We sat  
in captains chairs  
and folding chairs  
merrily around  
the round table  
of the many wedges and veneers  
made by my father,  
enjoying the tin of homemade  
chocolate chip cookies  
with the boys still silly and all  
while Anne tilted her head back  
and kept her teared eyes closed  
for five careful minutes  
to prevent the glaucoma.
