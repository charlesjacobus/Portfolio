The falafel, dolmadakia   
and baba ghanoush  
arrived in a box,  
each packed in styrofoam,  
and I made a salad  
full of colorful vegetables,  
and once everyone arrived  
we crowded around  
the unwanted table  
at the back of the house  
with a view of the wisteria  
and its newly strung fairy lights  
and talked over each other  
about Easters past  
and certain bright futures.
