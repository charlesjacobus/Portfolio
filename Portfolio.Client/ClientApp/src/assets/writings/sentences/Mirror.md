At the foot  
of the stairs  
beside  
the unmistakably American  
side table  
with spindly legs  
made by her father  
years earlier,  
over which hung  
a mirror  
that you caught  
yourself  
in each time  
descending,  
Janet mistook  
me for a cat  
in a more  
advanced stage  
of her dementia,  
thinking  
I might provide her  
with a ride  
to the depot  
for an appointment  
she did not have.
