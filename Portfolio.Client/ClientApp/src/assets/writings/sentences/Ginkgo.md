The pumpkin pie  
skinned stuffed  
lounge chair  
placed by the curb  
a few days ago  
disappeared  
behind the wall  
upon entering the room  
and was  
bisected by  
the adolescent  
burr oak  
upon settling into  
the ginkgo-leaved  
loveseat&mdash;&mdash;  
to talk with my parents  
on the telephone,  
while reflecting  
on the photograph  
taken at the reception  
in which they joyously  
squeeze into the very same  
loveseat  
with Grandma Blanchard  
who stares uncomfortably  
at her barely-touched cake,  
and then naturally  
to Brooklyn  
of a tree-lined  
and sun-dappled Sterling Place  
one sunny Sunday afternoon.
