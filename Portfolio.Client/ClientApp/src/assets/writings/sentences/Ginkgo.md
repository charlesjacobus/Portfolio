The pumpkin pie  
skinned stuffed  
lounge chair  
placed by the curb  
a few days ago  
disappeared  
behind the wall  
upon entering the room  
and was  
bisected by   
the adolescent  
burr oak  
upon settling into  
the ginkgo-leaved  
loveseat  
to talk with my parents  
on the telephone,  
while remembering first   
the photograph  
in which they joyously  
share the very same  
loveseat  
at the reception  
with Grandma Blanchard  
who stares uncomfortably  
at her barely-touched cake  
and then  
of a tree-lined   
and sun-dappled  
Sterling Place  
one Sunday afternoon.
