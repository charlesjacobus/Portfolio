The promise  
of the future  
in those days  
we discovered  
in dusty leaves  
of quiet stacks,  
complicated whispers  
and vertiginous photographs  
of failed or forgotten  
revolutions  
for which we  
enthusiastically enlisted,  
as the best or most  
viable means  
of forestalling  
mediocrity  
through the everyday  
cultural forces  
of conscription.
