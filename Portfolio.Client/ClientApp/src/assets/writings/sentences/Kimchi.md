So much depends  
upon  
cooking kimchi stew  
in a red Dutch oven  
on a slow burner,  
on a slow Sunday evening  
prematurely dark  
since an autumnal return  
to Standard time,  
washed in  
the soulful sounds  
of Yusef Lateef  
which Angela selected  
looking for Coltrane,  
with the dog  
standing underfoot  
watching attentively.
