There I am  
like the little figures  
in shallow relief  
of Ghiberti's bronze  
Baptistry Doors,  
each in several scenes  
simultaneously:  
splitting two cords  
of freshly cut wood  
beneath a cerulean sky,  
hauling piles heaved  
into the two-wheeled  
tired-turquoise barrow,  
and stacking the logs  
in the basement neatly  
inches from the wall  
to season, before being fed  
piecewise  
throughout winter  
into the fiery belly  
of the cast iron stove.
