There it stood  
motionless  
tucked tightly into  
that perpendicular place  
where wall meets ceiling  
waiting overhead  
while we sat  
in bed  
with a first cup of coffee  
arguing about the devil  
and reading Linda Pastan's  
obit and her poem about  
childbirth, fumbling  
references to Plath  
and Didion  
and Stewart  
and Wells  
and not once  
mentioning Kafka.
