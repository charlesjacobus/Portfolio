The **Watershed Project** immediately followed the **Handrail Project**, continuing my use of architecture for exploring aesthetic ideas.  

Where the Handrail Project provided a broad theoretical framework for considering both the relationship between the senses of sight and touch and the influence of the sense of touch on the arts throughout history, the Watershed Project explored a few particular aspects of the tactile aesthetic: shallow space, serial form, subtle variation, and the irrational.  

The Watershed Project was realized only with drawings. (I made no paintings at the time.) And it may have culminated with &mdash; at least in my mind &mdash; a separate project, the Relief House. Many years later, I came to realize that the Relief House was an attempt to burn the Watershed down.  

The Relief House now is a never-ending prose; it will never be complete just as the fire can never be extinguished. This is how it begins.  

---

The Relief House is a firehouse with no engine; the Relief House is a counterpoint to a watershed.  

The Relief House burned, and no amount of water could extinguish the flame. When all the wells ran dry, the townspeople voted unanimously to stop the fire fighting effort and let the fire exhaust itself naturally. After the first rains and snows failed to extinguish the fire, the magnitude of the problem became more apparent.  

Artists and poets seized upon the house for the subject of their pictures and poems. Some set up easels and others tripods. Others stood still before the house and composed poetry automatically. Careless videos proliferated and were watched by millions, aimlessly. Critics argued over the aesthetic merits of the house fire and the meaning of its significant form. Many imposed on its rage and in its dance references to the so-called ancients and primitives, theories invoking integrity and passions and truths that they were happy to share. One sensitive (but naively sentimental) poet reflected on the magical contrasts between the cool fall temperatures and the warmth of the flame and its embers, relating it figuratively to the brilliant blood red of a solitary Japanese maple in the crisp night air.  

The Relief House quickly became the cynosure of the town in which it raged. What was once an insignificant and nameless place emerged as a spot of significance - a place that people from all over the world had heard of and came to visit.  

What links architectural form in the Relief House is correspondence of time. For years - but definitely a finite period - the houses coexisted in space. Their relationship was proximal and accidental. It was almost certainly never considered. Given this period of coexistence, they shared architectural characteristics. After all, form is the product of a collective expression of shared experience. But that relationship came to a dramatic end one evening. So over a period of years following the event and ever since, the relationship has been reestablished through a reflective process of crystallization and imposition of need in the mind of the creator.  

The Relief House burned in America.  

The Relief House brought agency to the watershed, by expressing the house as it was conceived. This is the difference between planning and doing.  

The Relief House caught fire - some say spontaneously - and the fire never stopped, no matter the method nor the magnitude of the effort to extinguish it.  

The house had been unoccupied for years. Many of the neighboring residents initially and privately considered the fire a blessing.  

People came forward with money-making schemes to harness the fire. They included using it as a garbage incinerator and building an elaborate network of vents to harness the heat in order to produce electricity. One pious group, believing that the fire was a holy spirit or simultaneously a foretelling of a holy spirit, sold candles lit by the flame. Their venture proved unsuccessful, however, because the candles burned out quickly, as if lit by an ordinary match.  

The Relief House caught fire on a cold November night. People bundled up and came out to watch. They talked as the firemen worked and the house burned. Because of the odd material construction of the house, the fire burned unevenly. Much of the house smoldered, and in the dark of the night some of the stone walls appeared to glow. Since the house hadn't been occupied in many years, the effort to control the flame was concentrated on the exterior. There was talk of arson, but the question on everyone's mind was motive.  

The Relief House is the result of a superposition of three houses and one event over a period of two years. It began with a five-alarm fire that forever since has been raging through my conception which is the watershed.  

Philosophers were called, when fire crews failed to put out the fire. After much concentrated deliberation, they posited that the only thing capable of extinguishing the fire was the suffocating weight of the past.  

In one moment, this weight is exemplified through a box of albums, to be carried out the door. In this box, weight is concentrated in past invention and process and material (pressed platters and decorated sleeves) and through spent energies and fading memories of collection and possession, by way of burgeoning interests and intellectual pursuits and time spent idling through racks before making final purchases. To occupy a shared space for 25 years. In this respect, the weight accumulates through the countless hours and the efforts of many, much of it long ago, and it is in sum infinitely greater than the physical weight of the box. But the content of those platters, the radiance of sopranos and sonatas and brass and strings, is greater still. That creativity, a spark able to cross time and stir current spirits, embodies within it through apparent magic we call aesthetics a weight great enough that the fire might finally be exhausted.  

The Relief House had been burning for as long as anyone could remember. Children asked their parents and them their own about the cause of the fire, but no one could remember. Or, they remembered differently. Even the oldest residents were ignorant of its origin, but still closely identified with it. The fire figured prominently in local lore, and stories of the house were passed down among generations as a kind of local folk wisdom.  

Clearly the Relief House had been built, for there it stood.  

Smoke from the fire steadily billowed up and over the town in accord with the wind. Hot, dry summer days were bad, but rainy days were worse since the rain caused the fire to smolder and fume an ashen brown. Many residents of the area, especially the children, suffered from a debilitating asthma.  

Over the years, the fire transformed the Relief House in people's imaginations from a cultural or spiritual phenomenon to a natural one. Just as mountains and seas have no discernable beginning or end and no apparent purpose, the Relief House too transcended time and meaning in the minds of those who considered it. The fire had ceased to be an event and had become a fact.  

Word of the Relief House spread quickly, first among the neighboring towns and then throughout the state, the country, and eventually the world. Not knowing how to explain the fire, people attributed it to an act of God. They found what they believed were references to the house in the Bible, the Koran, and other sacred texts. The townspeople suddenly found themselves playing host to a steady stream of religious pilgrims and tourists. The local economy even flourished for a time, due to an aggressive and gaudy capitalization of the phenomenon.  

Owing to its unique architecture, the house appeared from some perspectives to be in a bas-relief. Approached from certain directions, its projection was so shallow and distorted as to make it practically invisible. Unfortunately, first responders arrived from the east side of town, which presented them with barely a surface to begin their work, causing confusion and frustrating the process of extinguishing the flames before they consumed the entire structure.  

The flames leapt from each of the windows in a discordant visual harmony, both regular and irregular. It was terrifyingly beautiful.  

The Relief House was forgotten, and yet it continued to burn. It seared in the collective memory, so the collective amnesia amounted to madness. If it had engulfed the whole world, there would be no difference. In fact it had, in the minds of mankind. It still burned. To those who could recall, the memories were seldom shared. And to those who could not, the very obvious fact of the house made little difference in their denial. They believed their denial an act of self-preservation, when it was in fact their undoing.  

The Relief House sparked a great intellectual debate about whether the house was burnt or unburnt. The argument being clear: while the house continued to burn, yet it stood.  

Someone needs to explain how the Relief House doesn't violate the laws of thermodynamics.  

Given its architectural characteristics, with the fire and smoke now considered by historians to be a permanent fixture of the structure, the Relief House existed in the fourth dimension. Never before had the interplay between time and space been used to such effect in architectural design. The closest comparison was to light and shadow, in the way it established a temporal variance in the form and definition on three dimensional space and two dimensional surface. But in the final analysis, light and shadow remain a product of the environment in which a structure exists as distinct from being elementally inherent in the construction, however that came about.  

Material composition of the Relief House consisted primarily of stone and wood, in a unique interwoven fabrication that had no known historical precedent. Throughout the structure, wood and stone interlaced in a veining tectonic to produce both beautiful ornamental detail and uncompromising support. Video sampling of the interior of the structure showed no signs of material compromise, aside from some relatively minor charring and glow. So a key question was whether this unique construction created an equilibrium supporting an inexhaustible fire or one that was just very slow to burn.  

Periodically over the intervening years, various people confessed to the arson, all with accounts inconsistent with actual events. For some would-be arsonists, their own births unwittingly succeeded the fire's origin. Understandably, each eager to find significance in their own lives through association with the timelessness of the Relief House.  

In conditions of storm and high wind, the fire would occasionally jump across the firebreak that had been established by the park service onto other surfaces, sparking new fires. Although these were quickly extinguished.  

People recall the Relief House. But their recollections are delusions or dreams or retellings, for they have never seen it.  

The Relief House is crowned by an edifice that undulates in peaks and troughs on its topmost surface, as waves. This structure is white gold or appears as such. It sits on the house awkwardly but impressively like a crown on the head of a monarch. In some places it projects outwardly creating shallow eaves. Tunneling throughout this structure is an elaborate network designed to capture and redirect rainwater, ejected in semi-regular spurts around the house in almost comical fashion, like a Baroque fountain. Had this roofing structure not been so impressive in its engineering, it would have been absurd.  

The fire both gave breath and it breathed, as a spirit.  

The heat from the Relief House fire was intense. And so naturally, people stood some distance from it. But even then, the intensity of the specter radiated through the clothes and into the flesh of those who stayed too long. And that heat remained with them, in their eyes and on their flesh and deeper still, for a long while after their departure. Many described this warmth as being interior, although physically felt on the surface. And that it would ebb and return, as memories drift.  

From the sides by which it could be seen, art critics reflected on the house with their pages of prose that bore little resemblance to the event that it was and more to the needs of the persons that they were. From this occupation, the cleverest among them made a decent living.  

The Relief House could be disorienting because the fire burned unevenly, producing great flames and smoke plumes and emberred glows variously and over time. Being a focal point of attention, this wreaked havoc on the stability of the cardinal points, in the approximation of many. The earth moved. Such disorientation caused agitation and anxiety when self-reflected. So this was discouraged by the park service, by developing processes designed to comfort people by keeping them moving and with instructions directing them to the correct parking lot.  

The fire transformed the Relief House into sculpture. This metamorphosis occurred organically and over time as it settled into the collective consciousness that the fire would not wane, rendering the house permanently uninhabitable. It was no longer something to occupy but something to observe. This distinction is of consequence rather than intent.  

Difficult to talk over, the fire roared and swooshed in accord with the intensity of the flame. The speaking of tongues was figurative, but it spoke over those who listened. During periods in which the fire principally smoldered, it listened.  

Some people claimed to have discovered a calendrical system in the character of the house, as it responded to changes in the environment over weeks and years. The house, as they saw it, established a grammar that brought order to the natural world. Using this system, they could sometimes predict changes in the intensity of the flame for example, or the direction in which the smoke billowed. But as these phenomenon were predictable by the environmental factors that preceded them, this system was considered self-referential. The model predicted the subject and vice versa. Others saw in the house the order of the natural world, which could not be put into words but which innately made sense, being one's self a part of the world.  

Models and maps are each technologies enabling the prediction of outcomes when applied. These predictions are not always correct, but they are always consistent with their application and limitations.  

No one ever suggested that the Relief House was a code, like the Code of Hammurabi, but that possibility should not be discounted. It may have been that the language of the fire was not didactic but that it magnified through its singularity the language of the wider natural world that is God. And that to operate as such a language one must first accept it as an article of faith.  

Elementally, the Relief House fire was quite natural; phenomenologically not so much.  

The smarter students, by applying various fallacies methodically, were able to approach the Relief House tangentially. Through this method of obscure description, they thought they were able to glean insights into the meaning of the Relief House, as one is sometimes first made aware of something by glimpsing it peripherally. But this only worked when the structure of their approach was symbiotic with the house structure itself; with too much self-awareness it fell apart and felt foolish. So they would have to start over and try again. In later communicating their insights, they sounded to others like nonsense. For instance, it was noted of interest that any one place can be so different over time. Hours pass and with it the light; seasons change and with it the weather; years pass and with it the built environment, etc. This observation seemed substantial, but besides further contemplation there was little more to be done with it.  

For people to say after visiting the Relief House that they know what it looks like, they likely mean instead that they have seen it recently and that there is some vivid mental picture or particular feeling that they have about it. As this mental picture or particular feeling subsides over time, so too should confidence in the assertion. The resonance of the feeling that "to have been" fades with time.  

By policy, the park service forbade flash photography.  

When considered as a model, those witnessing the Relief House recognized themselves uncomfortably as mere facts, or simple elements of that model. Their discomfort stemmed in part that they were simultaneously the modelers and the ones being modeled. And of course in part that they were reduced to mere facts.  

Imagine the two of us standing and talking together while watching the Relief House burn.  

The Relief House is a prose that reflects the house, which is the watershed. The reflection is a representation.  

A theory: the Relief House is extraterrestrial.  

In the mind of a dispassioned observer, it is impossible to tell the difference between "it happened" and "it is happening".  

Because no one living had ever been inside the Relief House, it could not be confirmed whether the house existed in the second or third dimension. (That it existed in the fourth dimension has elsewhere been established.) Surveyors and engineers ran calculations from the sides available to them, trying to arrive at a stable measurement of plan and volume. But for the discontinuities resulting from each of their data over the hours and days and weeks it took to produce and for the difficulties resulting from the practical matter of the fire, their attempts failed to establish anything definitive.  

The Relief House had no back side, as in "the backyard" or "the back of the house" or "out back".  

Still, if one stood on the opposite side of the front face, one would have seen a door that might be described as the back door but which was in fact the side door, secondary to the main door at the end of the long hallway. The disorientation between back and side was intentional and necessary to the dimensional characteristics of the house, and it of course preceded the fire.  

The Relief House presented windows on only one side and doors on two. Although one of those two sides was difficult to approach. The subtle variation in the spacing of the windows suggested something intentional, perhaps meaningful, certainly enigmatic. This variation was so subtle that it could not be trusted by sight alone; it required the hands and body haptically, which was of course now impossible. In this respect, the fire brought the Relief House into a more classical Western perspective, favoring visual depth. This was in antithesis of the extreme shallow planing and ornamentation of some early Medieval Italian church facades, for example, and in correspondence of that elaboration in the High Renaissance.  

The Relief House consists of eight or nine rooms, each in plan exactly the same but still serving different functions according to need. The house was plumbed after all. In volume, two of the rooms are barely perceptibly larger by a difference of ceiling height. One might sense this intuitively. This variance is not a purely aesthetic detail, but by suggesting purpose and intent is ennobling.  

The fire raged and spit out of the windows uniformly and consistently with the most distinctive characteristic of the fire&mdash;that over time it never ceased to burn. In fact, this uniformity was so apparently natural that some questioned why other fires burned only relatively short periods, when their physical immediate characteristics belied that very outcome.  

This raised questions about whether the Relief House fire was in fact a fire in the conventional or common sense. New words for this phenomenon might have been suggested, to better express it and to ease the mind.  

In the face of the fire, even the firemen were philosophers.  

The Relief House was the product of the people who witnessed it. From them, through their own interior lives, the house was manifest. That is why it was certified a cultural landmark, because it reflected the motivations and acts of mankind through the ages. As such, the house was collectively recognized as being a terrible tragedy, by the impossibility of reconciling the tension between the physical immediacy of the structure and the boundless temporality inherent in the event.  

That the Relief House fire could never be extinguished but was spoken of in the past imperfect tense is not an irony; it is essential to the nature of the form.  

Often, when we say "the house", we also mean the fire.  

Probability theorists reasoned both that the fire would soon exhaust itself and that it would rage forever. They made their cases variously by pointing out that the raw material of a house does not provide enough fuel to allow the structure to burn indefinitely and that there is no known historical record of such an incident. And of course there are natural physical laws, etc. So by entailment applied through probabilistic reasoning they maintained that the fire should soon wane. Some held this position over many years. Others concluded that since the fire had been burning for a very long time and showed no signs of change, despite historical precedent and every effort to extinguish it, that it would burn forever - or at least as long as forever held any meaning for mankind. Their models used expressions showing mathematically that the longer the Relief House burned, the greater the probability it would not cease to burn. Both positions implied, incorrectly and oppositionally, a causal nexus.  

The Relief House has two parallel hallways, one of which is for sight alone in passing. At the end of the main hallway is a great library, with few books. 

Seven rectangular columns form the division of the two hallways and seven of the rooms. The middle column is two inches wider than the others, defining a visual plane by establishing a center and emphasizing symmetry.  

The interior of the Relief House impressed upon the exterior, creating the fire. The fire was not born of combustion but of compression.  

Therefore, in an architectonic sense, the center hallway is our peripheral vision.  

If form follows function, then the function of the Relief House interior is to prioritize the temporal senses. The uniformity of the room composition is a field condition. Their repetition, tempo. And the subtle variance of their irregular spacing and ceiling height provide visual tension, which accentuates the tactile in counterpoint.  

The Relief House could no longer be touched.  

The Relief House fire was the visual variance in the bas-relief over time. The fire was the light and shadow interplay over the static structure of the relief, which was the house. Just as by virtue of time, the house and the fire were inseparable, so too were the fire and the light from the fire.  

The figures compressed in bas-relief are frozen in time, not space. They emerge and activate through the play of light over the sculpted material surface, as shadows forever receding. It is light that makes this possible.  

That the Relief House has eight or nine windows is a fact; that the Relief House has simultaneously eight and nine windows is also a fact.  

It was suggested that the fire could not be extinguished because the Relief House exists at a symbolic level without sufficient congruence to essential key structures of the physical, natural world. This also helped explain its physical anomalies, as noted elsewhere. But this was not the case; because it was that the watershed, not the Relief House, were to be extinguished. This is the principle reason why the job of extinguishing the fire remained so elusive. Put plainly, the fireman's hoses were aimed in the wrong direction.  

The Relief House cast shadows, as projections of its structure. Depending on the time of day and in relation to where you stood, through the fire the shadows reflected the structure itself or the immediate surroundings, which is analogous to dichotomies like exterior/interior or cool/warm.  

The fire and the smoke from the fire also sometimes cast shadows. So the fire was variously both the source of light resulting in shadow and the subject eclipsed resulting in shadow, seldom simultaneously.  

Analogously: With the only light source radiating from behind a bas-relief, the sculpted figures do not project except by feeling, through the sense of touch. They exist, but we cannot see them. As the light breaks from its eclipse, the figures gradually animate into the third-dimension and lose the immediacy of their tactile sense. Because sight precedes it, as a kind of foreshadowing sense. The projection is thereafter felt first through the eyes rather than the hands though still engaged haptically. Again, the center hallway.  

Temperature control in the Relief House was achieved through an obscure alliteration of wind and water, wisping and winding through windows and walls. The obscurity is in its relative invisibility. Cooling by ventilation, achieved through open windows and doors (a breeze is certain). And heating through radiation, by a network of pipes in the walls that circulates geothermal waters from deep underground. Temperature control is realized through a circulatory system. Mediating this is the natural insulating properties of the heavy wood and stone structure.  

The drainage system capping the Relief House was an inversion of construction of the heating system, although both worked by the passage of water.  

In the minds of those who directly experienced the Relief House and those who only learned of it through pictures and words, the Relief House is now the same.  

You have experienced the Relief House; the mental picture is indelible.  

Before the fire, on a random light-dappled afternoon, no one saw the flirting interplay of light and shadow as a foreshadowing that through the passage of time was certain to be.  

When recalling the Relief House, some people failed to mention the fire.  

As the fire burned over the weeks and years, the Relief House slowed commensurately.  

Time appeared to slow as one stood and watched the fire burn. This led some to reason that the fire wasn't burning for an extraordinary length of time after all - that this was just an illusion. And that not directing one's attention to the fire would cause the fire to extinguish, eventually. Of course this failed to explain the concentrated failures to extinguish the fire. Nor did it explain how visitors could return to the house after extended periods to find it still burning. But still, slowing suggested a resolution to the problem of the impossibility of the fire raging endlessly. And this explanation satisfied many.  

In time, the fire never repeated itself and yet over time it never seemed to change.  

It is reasonable to think that the fire compromised the plumbing.   

The fire sounded a low murmurous rumble - a din of displeasure loud enough to engulf casual conversation, proving it pointless. Its content was a finality comparable to a hollow wind, which follows and is the product of all the speech that ever preceded it, a white noise. Every word ever spoken by man is a jumble in the end. So the mumbling sonority of the Relief House fire was a foretelling.  

It would be absurd to describe the elaborate tendril of the flame, despite its natural flourish and Rococo qualities, as mannered or decorative.  

We believe that the Relief House cannot burn forever, even though it will burn longer than our ability to witness. Unlike the Sun, of which scientists have some reasonable astronomical and chemical understanding and so can predict its eventual end, the Relief House is so far beyond understanding. Consequently, this conviction that it cannot burn forever is an act of faith rather than fact. Although that faith is in a universality of natural laws, not mythologies.  

While standing before the Relief House, most people believe that it exists. Others, having only experienced the Relief House through media or having only heard of it, may also believe that it exists. For each, the fact of its existence is equivalent, to the extent that they believe it.  

Psychiatrists and psychologists weighed in with their opinions of the Relief House, which were entirely consistent with their view of the world. In their analysis, the Relief House represented the human spirit, with its boundless energy ultimately constrained by time. The physical embodiment of this constraint was the structure itself, with its architectural character of linearity and repetition clearly suggesting sequence and temporality. In this view, the Relief House would be tragic. That the fire could not be extinguished suggested that the Relief House stood for humankind its own desires for a fate different than the one granted by the creator. So their professional opinions were that the house fire may in fact not exist except as a collective psychosis, despite of course evidence to the contrary.  

The bounds of epistemic justification were the senses (all of them) and the ability to comprehend the meaning of "forever". Standing before the fire it was perfectly rational to believe in the fire as fact, in its existence. But the bounds of this rationality were, practically speaking, just those moments. To consider the fire as a phenomenon that started spontaneously and would never be extinguished was utter nonsense. And everything between those two states of belief were uncomfortably difficult to explain.  

The hands of an analogue clock reflect our common conception of time, as a blinking eye. Each little pause is a time slice marking a state of being one might commit to memory and recall. Each little pause swallows a moment in time encompassing infinite multitudes, more than we can ever know, as each particular state of affairs shall never exist again.  

The Relief House measured time. But over time, due to the longevity and apparent constancy of state, the Relief House became timeless. In being, there was no past tense distinguishable from the present or future.  

As a timepiece, only an historical perspective provided correspondence between the movement of the hands of a clock and the Relief House fire. Time creates distance in all things, and this distance reduces the particularity and variation of the fire in each passing moment to few words. Standing against time, silence is the only appropriate means of expression.  

What is familiar is new, each time.  

Talk of the Relief House yielded nothing conclusive. In fact, the more one talked the more elusive the Relief House became. So for some, saying nothing became the most effective intellectual antidote to the rhetorical flourishes that ultimately succeeded only in obfuscating "the problem", as it were, of the fire. The best counter argument to the intellectual austerity of this position was that the circuitous nature of the dialog helped to pass the time.  

Our experience of time is the closest we can ever get to a conception of God that is not anthropomorphic.  

The Relief House is a theory, not a model.  

What history could be made of the Relief House should it be spoken of or put in a book? The fire raged, and in time this had a bearing on history. It affected people, who witnessed it and who considered its significance and who related it to others and who remembered it. But the Relief House itself was by its very existence and significance unchanged. So there was no history in the house per se.
