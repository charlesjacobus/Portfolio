    <div class="title">Galactic Model</div>
    <div class="paragraph">For a few months many years ago, I had the perfectly terrible idea of making still-life paintings of fruit in some cosmic arrangement &mdash; no doubt inspired by those incredible still-lifes by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_S치nchez_Cot치n" target="_blank">Joan S치nchez Cot치n</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraphs">These works consisted of apples in half and quarter segments, half-eaten grapefruits, tangerines in eclipsing composition, and these bananas which I imagined in the form of a galactic model. In this case, a ring galaxy I suppose, although that kind of detail remains not particularly relevant.</div>

    <div class="label">1991 - 1992 : oil on canvas : 11 x 12 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The painting exemplifies a maturity in my technique, with it's relatively heavy impasto and many-layered overpainting. The result of which produces a rough ground and <em>pentimenti</em> &mdash; note the contour of an earlier, misplaced fruit &mdash; as well as natural surface interests from foreign matter picked up by the paint over many applications of wet-on-dry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Notice how the warm coloring of the skin represents the soft geometry of the fruit and how the cold and transparent tones of the multiple shadows help set them onto the starry planes. Field and ground are naturally defined and yet dissolved.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Most significantly for me, this was my first monochrome painting. Many ideas about touch and tactility evolved over the next few years from this work, which is why it remains a survivor.</div>
