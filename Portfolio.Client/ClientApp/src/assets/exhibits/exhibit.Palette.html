    <div class="label">1994 - 2001 : oil on handmade wood palette : 5 x 15 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The challenge of this series is that the working process remains non-intentional, with respect to any outcome or finished product. In other words, the palette must remain a palette until it is a painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Most of these paintings are on ceramic, because of its economy and utility as a working surface. But some, such as this one, are on wood because that was the material at hand &mdash; in this case, an old bread board.</div>
