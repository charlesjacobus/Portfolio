    <div class="paragraph">Over the years, finished work has emerged through what I recognized only after the fact as something significant and complete in its own right; these are all finished paintings. Not artifacts or curiosities of painterly activity but finished paintings with all the consideration that implies &mdash; perhaps like leaves of a sketchbook that after some time emerge as more significant statements of "art" than others, which retain the imprint of mere study or sketch.</div>

    <div class="label">1994 - 2001 : oil on handmade wood palette : 5 x 15 inches</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The challenge of this series is that the painting process remain non-intentional, with respect to any outcome or finished product. In other words, the palette must remain a palette until it is a painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Most of these paintings are on ceramic, because of its economy and utility as a working surface. But some, such as this one, are on wood because that was the material at hand &mdash; in this case, an old bread board.</div>

    <div class="label">1998 - 2000 : oil on wood platter : 12 inches diameter</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I often spend months or years on a single work. So these paintings necessarily contain some of the hue and tonal character of other work. In the example above, a Handrail painting. And in this latest piece, some of the more recent paintings from <a href="/exhibits/death">A Death in the Family</a> clearly come through.</div>
