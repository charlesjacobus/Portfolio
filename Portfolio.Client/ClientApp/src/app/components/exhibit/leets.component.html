            **Leet** is a lifetime series and now a game.

            The series consists of three compositions (G, M and F). For purposes of this game, the composition is randomly generated.

            Each leet is described by a code. The code produces a cartoon, which is a plan. I use the plan to produce the leet, which is a 42 x 30 inch oil painting on stretched cotton duck canvas.

            The game involves a commission, in the form of a commercial transaction - an oil painting for money. The amount of money is up to you, but it must include materials ($50), packing ($20), and shipping costs (TBD). Shipping costs are provided once I have a delivery address. Or, you can pick it up.

            Once I begin a leet, I will complete it. But multiple commission requests are priority queued, by price paid over materials, packing, and shipping costs. This means the lower your price point, the longer you may have to wait. Of course, it also means that if your price point is low and you don't wait long, then I'm likely pwned.

            To participate: Click **Create Cartoon** until you find a leet you like. Then click **Order Leet**. Or, click **Capture Code** to put the leet code on your clipboard, which you can email me.

            I may refuse this game prior to accepting a commission or end it at any time.
