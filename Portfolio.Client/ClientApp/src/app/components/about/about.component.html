            <div class="aboutQuote aboutSite">Some painters, including myself, do not care what chair they are sitting on. It does not even have to be a comfortable one. They are too nervous to find out where they ought to sit. They do not want to "sit in style". Rather, they have found that painting &mdash; any kind of painting, any style of painting &mdash; to be painting at all, in fact &mdash; is a way of living today, a style of living, so to speak... It is exactly in its uselessness that it is free.</div>

        <div class="aboutParagraph">Tactility and touch; quietude, slowness, particularity, recall, and the totality of things; tonality and atonality; permanence and impermanence; the general and specific &mdash; all qualities that I feel define a moral basis for aesthetic and political value.</div>
        <div class="aboutParagraph">This value manifests in the capacity for appreciation and the need to perceive &mdash; that is, <em>to be</em>, through expressions of that fact. My work is intentionally small and a project for a lifetime.</div>
